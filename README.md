Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas—
If I wasn't rappin', bitch,
I might just be the president
Pleas with the beggin',
that shit dwindlin'
your relevance
We know your shit is droppin',
we ain't coppin' what
you sellin' us
Bitch, you was good in school,
why you hidin'
your intelligence?
I remember when you was
gettin' A's, now you failin' us
Playin' hard for the white
boys that can't tell the diff'
Caught a lot of bodies,
so my closet, it got skeletons
Don't believe me? Call
your favorite rapper for
the evidence
Rolls Royce,
please don't sell these
rappers no more Cullinans
They unoriginal,
and plus I know they don't
be budgetin'
Come in, boy, I'm sonnin' them,
they know I'm really one
of them
Two six,
lotta screws loose with
my brudda'nem
He got a speech impediment
from choppers he be cuddlin'
He say he like the way that
shit be s-s-s-s-stutterin'
When I'm in the city,
bitches screamin' out
my government
When I'm in the city,
bitches screamin'—
(Jermaine, ayy-ayy)
Outcast but I was never cast out
I'm a small fish from
a pond where they crash out
(Ayy-ayy)
Slim odds for a nigga gettin'
to this cash route
Like a rap bitch goin'
plat' without her ass out
(Ayy-ayy)
When you see your nigga on
the boulevard
(Ayy-ayy)
Roll your window down,
holler from afar
(Ayy-ayy)
If you spot a 'Ville nigga,
lock your car
(Ayy-ayy)
It's a real good chance he's a—
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild
Bitch, I be low on purpose,
big hoodie, double XL
Niggas be sayin' I'm humble
as hell, not knowin' I'm bougie
I got standards, nigga,
I damn near can't even stay
at the Mandarin, nigga
That shit feel old to me,
my cribs,
they never get sold to me
Them bitches get built for me
Like cheerleaders,
I'm steppin' on these
niggas skillfully
And I don't want 'em to kill
for me,
and I don't want nobody
gettin' killed for me
Nigga, that shit lame,
then again,
I guess that's your lane
In the nineties it was
crack cocaine,
nowadays it's clout and fame
Niggas is gassed,
goin' viral off hate and
shit a disgrace
Y'all ain't even gettin' no bags
Y'all call 'em bags,
but my type of bags,
they can't even fit in the back
I'm the future of this rap shit,
nigga,
fuck everything that I did
in the past
I'm blowin' it out the water,
if the times get hard,
I just go harder, nigga
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
(I said I just go harder, nigga)
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild, bitch
Two six niggas wild
(Ayy-ayy)
When you see your nigga on
the boulevard
(Ayy-ayy)
Roll your window down,
holler from afar
(Ayy-ayy)
If you spot a 'Ville nigga,
lock your car
(Ayy-ayy)
It's a real good chance
he's a dawg
(Ayy-ayy)
The sky was covered by
clouds like the color of
the smoke
I couldn't see the Sun,
I couldn't see the Sun
But I clung to a glimmer of hope
A thousand miles from Heaven
and a block away from the slums
Adjacent to the hood just
like the pointer is to
the thumb
Some days I had to use 'em
both for pickin' up them crumbs
To place upon my tongue
knowin' the hunger would
not numb
Be careful of the devil and
the melodies you hum
Smilin',
goin' viral while infectin'
all of the young
I was lost back then,
I was blind, deaf, and dumb,
huh
But I knew I'd find me a way
Fell off and fell on my face
But I knew I'd find a way
